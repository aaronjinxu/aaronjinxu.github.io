## About Me

My name is Jin Xu. I was born in China, and currently live in Edinburgh, a beautiful city loved by all her residents. I am a postgraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. Besides papers, I am also fond of film art and novels. I hope that one day, my hard work can do something good to this world, and I also hope that I can get the chance to set foot on every land of this planet in my lifetime.
